# GoRestAPI
My first attempt to create a Rest API in GO.


## Structure

In the `main.go` file, I define the functions needed to handle my service.
The `homePage` will manage all the root URL requests. A `handleRequest` function that will match the URL path hit with a defined function. Finally a `main` function which will execute all.
